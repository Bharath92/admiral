## Features

- **Additional features for Jacoco code coverage reports**: The following features have been added to Jacoco code coverage reports. More details in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/tutorials/ci/code-coverage-jacoco/):
     - Individual file level detail: Now all the methods in a particular class will be shown, and to see the details of a specific method, simply click on that method name and then that particular file will be shown with the lines and branches that are fully covered (shown in dark green), partially covered (shown in grey) and uncovered (shown in dark red)

     - Trend graphs: Below the 'Overall Coverage Summary' section, you can see average line coverage trend graph and branch coverage trend graph for overall coverage results of the last ten runs. The Red color shows the missed line and branch coverage, whereas the green color depicts the covered line and branch coverage

     - Download Jacoco reports from UI: In the Job Coverage Files section you can download the code coverage file in the .tar.gz format

- **Support placement strategies for Amazon's EC2 Container Service(ECS)**: ECS has added support for various placement strategies in their services. We now allow our users to set these fields. Read more in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/resources/dockerOptions/#amazon-ecs)

## Server installer changes
- `systemSettings` now includes `ircBotNick` for IRC notification: This can be used to enable IRC notification
- Pulls new image versions, verifies settings before stopping services for an upgrade
- Stops all stateless services before upgrading: This ensures the services will always have the latest ENVs.
- Added `state.json` validation before and after each section
- Skips image download if already pulled

## Fixes

- **Builds appear stuck in processing state for subscriptions**: In some cases, all the scripts ran and notifications were sent. However, the build job version was not posted and build status was not updated showing the build in a processing state. The fix resolves the issue. **ACTION REQUIRED for subscriptions with Custom Nodes (BYON)** Please reset all your custom nodes for the fix to be implemented.
- **GitHub webhook not running for users who have not logged into Shippable**: We've released a fix for GitHub webhooks not triggering builds for some users. For the PRs that were missed,  updating the PR or closing/reopening will run a build
- **Error running some runSH jobs with gitRepo inputs**: The fix ensures the build runs successfully when a runSH job is triggered manually
- **Direct link to a specific job does not load full page**: The link now navigates to the correct job and loads the full page for that job
- **Pipeline UI fixes**: With this fix, the console should no longer fluctuate/flicker. Auto-scrolling/tailing added to pipeline console
- **Unable to update a credit card without the plan changing**: Credit card should be updated without the plan changing or losing existing discounts
- **Project sync resets a project's branches to be displayed**: With this fix, Project 'Sync' does not reset and revert back to default branch. The project's branches will continue to be displayed
- **Wildcard not recognized in the branches list in notifications**: We now allow wildcards in the notifications section for including/excluding branches. Details in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/branches/)
- **Unable to access Shippable website using IE11**: With this fix, IE11 users should be able to access [Shippable website](https://app.shippable.com)
- **Blank space shown in dashboard when Release title is unavailable** If the Release title is unavailable, we now show the tag name instead in the dashboard
- **Error when Pipeline resource name contains a dot character**: Pipeline resource names can now include a "."
- **Private git submodule sync is broken in runSh**: The submodule sync has been fixed and will work successfully
- **Adds gitRepo variables and removed VERSION, SEED and other variables**: Access the updated list in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/jobs/runSh/#resource-variables)
     - gitRepo resource variables added
     - Removes the VERSION variables; the VERSIONID, VERSIONNAME and VERSIONNUMBER vars are now of the pattern _VERSIONID_
     - Removes all POINTER variables; _POINTER_SOURCENAME_ is now _SOURCENAME_
     - Removes all SEED variables, except _SEED_VERSIONNAME_
- **Removing a `masterIntegration` from the `state.json` file does not remove the corresponding service**: This fix ensures removing any service from the `state.json` will remove the corresponding service

## Upgrading Server to 5.1.5
To upgrade Shippable Server, follow the instructions below. All steps in the upgrade happen on the Swarm Master machine except when noted otherwise.

- **Pre-installation**:

     - [ ] Backup the [`usr/state.json` file](http://docs.shippable.com/server/backup-restore-procedures/#backup-installer) and the [Postgres database](http://docs.shippable.com/server/backup-restore-procedures/#backup-Postgres) (on the core machine)
     - [ ] Pull the latest code by running the following:
          - `git fetch`
          - `git tag`
          - `git checkout v5.1.5`
     - [ ] Add new changes to the installer
          - [ ] Copy the entire entry of `rootQueueList` from the `state.json.example` file to the `state.json` file
          - [ ] Search for `systemIntegration` array in `state.json.example` file and copy the following:

          ```
          {
            "name": "AWS",
            "masterName": "AWS",
            "masterType": "cloudproviders",
            "formJSONValues": [
             {
               "label": "accessKey",
               "value": "xxxx"
             },
             {
               "label": "secretKey",
               "value": "xxxx"
             }
            ]
          },
          ```

          - [ ] Search for `rootS3bucket` array in `state.json.example` file and copy the `"rootS3Bucket": ""` into the `state.json` file
          - [ ] Search for `systemSettings` section in `state.json.example` file and copy the values of the following into the `state.json` file
              - `wwwPort`, `redisUrl`, `awsAccountId`, `jobConsoleBatchSize`, `jobConsoleBufferTimeInterval`, `defaultCronLoopHours`, `apiRetryInterval`, `vortexUrl`, `truck`, `hubspotTimeLimit`, `hubspotListId` and `hubspotShouldSimulate`.
              - Ensure `truck` is set to false
              - Ensure `redisUrl`  & `vortexURL` needs to be set correctly

     - [ ] Update systemSettings in `state.json` by copying the  `"ircBotNick": "shippable",` from the `state.json.example` file for irc notifications
     - [ ] Ensure `state.json` has the right flags set for `.machines`:

          * Service Machines:
