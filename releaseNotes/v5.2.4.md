# 5.2.4 Release Notes
## Release Date
9:00pm PST, Thursday, Feb 23, 2017

## Features
- **More environmental variables in runSh and runCLI jobs**: Environmental variables `POINTER`, `SEED`, `RESOURCENAME_HTTPS_URL`, `RESOURCENAME_SSH_URL` and `RESOURCENAME_KEYPATH` are added. Read more in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/jobs/runSh/#resource-variables)

## Fixes
- **Newly created branches were not displaying without force syncing project**: This fix ensures the branch list for a project is updated each time a build is triggered.
- **`envsubst` command does not work**: The default images are updated to include the `gettext` package
- **'Reset' button shown for non-Shippable initialized Custom Nodes**: Custom hosts that used the option `I want to run the scripts myself` to initialize nodes [cannot be reset](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/byon/#resetting-a-build-node). The scripts have to be re-downloaded and run on the node. This fix hides the 'Reset' button
- **`rSync` jobs fail for some Bitbucket customers**
- **`time` resources occasionally trigger twice**
- **Build stuck at `Provisioning a node for subscription:` for projects that were previously paused**: The fix sets the project's properties correctly when paused. The builds will run successfully, after the project is resumed.
- **Pull Request web hooks fail to trigger CI**: This fix adds a retry logic to mitigate the issue
