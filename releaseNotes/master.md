# ${RES_VER_NAME} Release Notes

## Release Date
${RES_VER_DATE}

## Features
  - **Extra billing information**: Subscription billing page now has an option to enter custom billing information. You can use this to specify tax information and billing addresses, for example, to be included on your payment receipts. See the [Subscription Billing](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/management/subscription/billing/) for more details.
  - **Improved account sync indicator**: A spinning refresh icon will appear in the sidebar next to the subscriptions header when an account is being synchronized. Accounts will be automatically synchronized after new SCM integrations are created.

## Fixes
  - **Subscriptions not shown when sidebar is collapsed**: When the sidebar is a collapsed state and you hover over the SCM icon, you can view all your subscriptions. This allows you to navigate to all the subscriptions in your SCM with the sidebar collapsed, improving the usability of the collapsed sidebar.
  
  - **Support single quotes in runSh jobs that run on Windows**: Single quotes can be added to the script, on_failure, always and other sections in runSh jobs. 
  
  - **Custom information as part of the invoice**: You can now add custom information as part of your invoice such as a purchase order number, or official company name.
