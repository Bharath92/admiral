## Release Date

${REL_VER_DATE}

## Features

- **Added `size` column for subscription node pools table**: The [Subscription Node Pools](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/management/subscription/node-pools/) panel in a subscription's "Node Pools" page now shows you a "Size" column if you have any On Demand node pools, making it easier to identify how your node pools have been configured.

## Fixes

- **Fixes styling of `h3` elements in changelog**: `h3` headings are now formatted correctly in the changelog.
- **Fixes meta tags in Shippable documentation**: The HTML meta tags for page description in the [Shippable documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/) were malformed. These tags have been fixed.
- **Fixes webhook integrations can't be created as org integrations**: It was not possible to create [Webhook integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/webhook/) as as [org integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/integration/subscription-integrations/#creating-an-org-integration-recommended-for-teams). This has now been enabled.
