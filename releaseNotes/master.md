## Features
  - **gitRepo deployments to node clusters**: gitRepo resources may be used as inputs in deploy jobs to deploy those repositories to node clusters. An example deploying a gitRepo to a node cluster after CI is documented [here](docs.shippable.com/deploy/vm-gitRepo/).
      - The gitRepo inputs will only be deployed to node clusters; other cluster types are not supported.
