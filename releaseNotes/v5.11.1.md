### Bug Fixes
- fixed html injection vulnerability in test reports
- updated microservice versions of nodejs to avoid [DOS security vulnerability](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/oct-2017-dos/)
- modify account delete workflow to reduce errors that prevent it from succeeding

### Features
- enhanced ECS managed deployments to retry 'get service' calls, to avoid intermittent issues where ECS returns no data, despite the service existing.
- for ECS managed deployments, setting memoryReservation in dockerOptions will avoid the default value for the memory option
- bastion hosts can now be defined for Kubernetes as part of the cluster resource, rather than in the integration itself. this allows for greating flexibility.
- key/value pairs saved to assembly line job state will now be visible in the UI on the job dashboard
- jobs/resources in the spog will show additional information on hover
- select subscription will be highlighted in the sidebar
- syncRepo type resources are now allowed as jobs in the shippable.yml for the purpose of adding global flags. [see docs](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/workflow/resource/syncrepo/)
- Shippable Assembly Lines configuration files have all been consolidated.  Instead of defining 3 separate files, all resources, jobs, and triggers should be defined in the same file: `shippable.yml`. [see docs](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/workflow/shippable-yml/)
- Introduce new option to run runSh jobs in parallel with themselves.
- many [devops-recipes](https://github.com/devops-recipes) examples have been updated to reflect integration and config file changes

### New Integrations
As we continue to clean up our integrations, several existing integrations have been deprecated and replaced with more generic/flexible versions. No action is necessary

Updated integrations:
- [Docker Datacenter](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/ddcKey/)
- [AWS IAM](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/aws-iam/)
- [Azure DC/OS](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/azureDcosKey/)
- [Webhook](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/webhook/)
- [Joyent Triton](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/joyentTritonKey/)
- [Docker Cloud](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/dclKey/)
- [Kubernetes](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/kubernetes-config/)


### Deprecations
**Assembly Lines Config Files**
Shippable.jobs.yml, Shippable.resources.yml, and Shippable.triggers.yml have been deprecated.  They will continue to work through the forseeable future, however the preferred method is to include your jobs/resources/triggers directly in your [shippable.yml file](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/tutorial/workflow/shippable-yml/)

**Integrations**
If you are using any deprecated integrations in your Assembly lines or CI, they will continue to work without any disruptions. You can update them or delete them, but cannot create new ones
