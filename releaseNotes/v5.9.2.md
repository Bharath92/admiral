### Bug fixes

1. Transient error in Saving Job Files
    - Recovers from errors in Builds in case of vault outage and surfaces vault failures in Shippable API for figuring out outages.

1. buildJobs failing to post with 413: entity too large
    - removes unnecessary information from the trace array to avoid exponential growth under certain conditions.

1. When searching by id or name on the admin subscriptions search page, clicking the "Search" button immediately clears current results
    - Searching by id or name would result in results being appended for each search. This is now fixed to clear results before each search is initiated.

1. Misleading duration reported for some jobs
   - Uses a custom duration format to display job durations in hours and minutes.

1. The flags dropdown is fully visible on subscription dashboards when all panels are collapsed
   - When there are multiple flags (greater than 10) , they are not shown when other items on the page are collapsed

1. When there are no flags, the link to documentation needs to be fixed
     - Fixed broken link to documentation

1. Limit the number of results returned in a "resource" search to the selected record count
     - Fixed by sending the selected record count to the table

1. Update buildJobs/getS to support createdBefore and createdAfter query parameters
    - updated buildJobs/getS to query by createdBefore and createdAfter

1. UI performance enhancements
    - UI load time and navigation performance has been improved

### Features

1. added get_resource_version_key to shipctl
    - get_resource_version_key is added to u14 & u16 so that it can be used via shipctl

1. Update search page to allow jobs search with project id
   - users can search for job type resources based on a particular project
