### New Integrations
As we continue to clean up our integrations, several existing integrations have been deprecated and replaced with more generic/flexible versions. No action is necessary

Updated integrations:
1. Azure Keys Integration next generation launched

    - The current [Azure](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/azure/) integration will be replaced by the next generation of  [Azure](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/azure-keys/) integration of type `generic`. This is being done as part of standardizing how Shippable works with integrations and allows us to use it in a generic fashion as opposed to duplicating it for every implementation. All existing functionality works as it is and the new azure integration will work exactly the same way as the deprecated integrations would work.

    - If you are using the deprecated integration in your Assembly lines, it will continue to work without any disruptions. You can update it or delete it, but a new instance of the deprecated version cannot be created.
