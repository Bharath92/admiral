### Bug Fixes

1. Switching from ARM Custom Nodes to x86 Shippable Nodes no longer produces an error.
1. All accountIntegrations of the correct type are properly shown in the dropdown when editing a subscriptionIntegration.
1. Dryrun pipelines now work correctly when utilizing new generic integrations
1. Kubernetes service provisioning of type LoadBalancer will no longer produce an exception.

### Features

1. integrations.  We're moving towards a slightly different integration model.  New integrations will typically appear in the "generic" category and will tend to be a bit less specific than our old style integrations.  The old integrations will continue to work, and can still be edited/deleted, but can no longer be created.  
  - new generic integrations released:
    - node cluster
    - hipchat
    - slack
    - docker registry
    - google cloud
  - old integrations deprecated
    - gke, gcr, gce
    - slack (non-generic)
    - hipchat (non-generic)
    - docker
    - private docker registry

2. New system machine image, preloaded with new drydock build images.  v5.10.4 SMI is now available for use in production. [See docs](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/machine-image/ami-v5104/) for details
3. serviceName, serviceId (ARN) are now available in ECS deploy job versions.
4. new "reset" option for ECS deployments.  [see docs](http://docs.shippable.com/deploy/amazon-ecs-deploy-reset/) for a description and example.
5. **Node Cluster Integration next generation launched** 
- The current [node cluster](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/node-cluster/) integration of type `cluster` will be replaced by next generation of [node cluster](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/nodeCluster/) integration of type `generic`. This is being done as part of standardizing how Shippable works with integrations and allows us to use it it in a generic fashion as opposed to duplicating it for every implementation. All existing functionality works as is
- If you are using the deprecated integration in your Assembly lines, it will continue to work without any disruptions. You can update it or delete it, but a new instance of the deprecated version cannot be created.
- These are some samples of using this integrations

6. **Docker Registry Integration next generation launched**
* The current ```Docker``` integration of type hub, ```Private docker registry``` integration of type hub and ```Docker Trusted Registry``` integration of type hub will be replaced by the next generation of ```Docker Registry``` integration of type generic. This is being done as part of standardizing how Shippable works with integrations and allows us to use it in a generic fashion as opposed to duplicating it for every implementation. All existing functionality works as it is and the new ```Docker Registry``` integration will work exactly the same way as the deprecated integrations would work.
* If you are using any deprecated integrations in your Assembly lines or CI, it will continue to work without any disruptions. You can update it or delete it, but a new instance of the deprecated version cannot be created.
* These are few Sample Project Links of using this integration:
     * [CI for a Node.js project which pushes Docker image to Docker Hub](https://github.com/devops-recipes/ci-push-docker-hub)
     * [CI for a Node.js project which pushes Docker image to Private Docker Registry](https://github.com/devops-recipes/ci-push-docker-private-registry)
     * [Build and Deploy a Node.js docker image to Kubernetes using Shippable pipelines](https://github.com/devops-recipes/deploy-kubernetes-basic)

7. #### Google Cloud Integration next generation launched

- The current [GCR](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/gcr/) integration of type `hub`, [GCL](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/gce/) integration of type `generic` and [GKE](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/gke/) integration of type `deploy` will be replaced by the next generation of  [Google Cloud](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/integration/gcloudKey/) integration of type `generic`. This is being done as part of standardizing how Shippable works with integrations and allows us to use it it in a generic fashion as opposed to duplicating it for every implementation. All existing functionality works as it is and the new Google Cloud integration will work exactly the same way as the deprecated integrations would work.

- If you are using the deprecated integration in your Assembly lines or CI, it will continue to work without any disruptions. You can update it or delete it, but a new instance of the deprecated version cannot be created.
