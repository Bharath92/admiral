# 5.3.2 Release Notes
## Release Date
8:30pm PST, Saturday, March 11, 2017

## Features
- **Web App URLs are now friendly**: URLs now show source control username, project name, etc. No more ugly GUIDs!
- **New default Docker images launched**: From release 5.3.2 onwards, Shippable will introduce new machine images on each release with the latest tooling and official Docker images. [Read more here](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/machineImages/)
- **Support for docker 1.13 with ubuntu 14.04/16.04**: Examples in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/byon/)
- **Custom Dashboard**: Users can create a personal dashboard to view only projects they're interested in.
- **API documentation updated**: We've moved to using Swagger to document the API so it is always up to date.
- **Support for YML dictionary format in CI environment variables**: Ability to specify multiple environment variables on separate lines without triggering a matrix build. Examples in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/environmentVariables/#user-defined-variables)
- **Migrate resources/jobs/triggers from one syncRepo to another**: Ability to move your pipelines config to a new repo. [Learn more](http://docs.shippable.com/tutorials/pipelines/migrateResources/)
- **Service deployments and custom namespaces for Kubernetes**: Examples in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/jobs/provision/#kubernetes)
- **Support for passthrough dockerOptions for Kubernetes**: Examples in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/resources/dockerOptions/#kubernetes)

## Fixes
- **Account deletion fails when a user has lost access to an enabled project**
- **Few jobs timing out before reaching `build_ci`**: The job trigger has been refactored to fix this issue
- **CI jobs fail when trying to pull Docker images**: Jobs failed due to a [Docker DNS issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/18842). This fix adds a nameserver to the stable/unstable AMIs and resolves the issue
