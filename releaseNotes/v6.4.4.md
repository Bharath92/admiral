# v6.4.4 Release Notes

## Release Date
Monday, Apr 30 2018

## Features
  - **Failure logs in email notifications**: Email notifications for both CI and Assembly Lines can be configured to include log output of failing commands with the `sendFailingSnippet` option. To enable this, see the [CI email](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/email-notifications/) or [Assembly Lines configuration](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/workflow/config/#assembly-lines-configuration) documentation.

## Fixes
  - Listing a webhook subscription integration with no linked account integration in a CI shippable.yml now creates a run with the same error message as other integration types.
  - Docker integrations will now properly log in on Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7 dynamic nodes.
  - Job names in SPOG will wrap to a second line if space is available.
  - Fixed a crash in the internal "sync" service.
  - New NOTIFY line syntax in pipeline jobs will now properly trigger the notification workflow.
  - on_success webhook logs will no longer be cut off by the log archiving service.
  - When searching SPOG for a particular job, if that job is stale, the search highlight will take priority over the stale highlight.
  - When a build's webhook payload fails to send due to a parsing error, a helpful message will be displayed in the logs.

## Custom Nodes
  - **Node status updated when nodes do not report a status**: If a node has not sent updated node statistics for 15 minutes (configurable in Shippable Server installations), the node status will be updated to failed and jobs will not be queued for that node.

## Shippable Server
