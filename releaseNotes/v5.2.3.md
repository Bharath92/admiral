# 5.2.3 Release Notes
## Release Date
8:00pm PST, Friday, Feb 17, 2017

## Features
- **Ability to configure CI Projects as Pipeline jobs** A new resource [`ciRepo`](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/resources/ciRepo/) and a new job [`runCI`](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/jobs/runCI/) allow configuring CI projects as Pipeline jobs. Check out the [tutorial for connecting CI to Pipelines](http://docs.shippable.com/tutorials/pipelines/connectingCiPipelines/)
- **Integrations added to `cliConfig` resource**: Docker Trusted Registry, JFrog Artifactory, Private Docker Registry, Terraform and Packer have been added to the existing list of [supported integrations](http://docs.shippable.com/pipelines/resources/cliConfig/#supported-integrations)
- **More environmental variables in runSh and runCLI jobs**: The following variables `JOB_PATH`, `JOB_STATE`, `JOB_PREVIOUS_STATE`, `JOB_MESSAGE`, `JOBNAME_NAME`, `JOBNAME_TYPE`, `JOBNAME_PATH`,`JOBNAME_STATE`, `JOBNAME_PREVIOUS_STATE`, `JOBNAME_MESSAGE`, `RESOURCENAME_STATE` and `RESOURCENAME_META` are added. Read more in our [documentation](docs.shippable.com/pipelines/jobs/runSh/#runsh-environment-variables)
- **All subscriptions running on Shippable Nodes have an updated Shippable Agent**: We made changes to the Shippable agent for improved performance. Read more about it in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-build-container-cexec-and-shippable-agent-genexec-on-the-shippable-platform).
- **Custom Nodes reset to implement the updated Shippable Agent**: A reset was enforced for all custom nodes that were not reset since the [5.2.2 release](https://github.com/Shippable/support/wiki/5-2-2). Builds will fail on custom nodes initialized using a script, if they have not been reset. For more details, read the [FAQ section on this issue](http://docs.shippable.com/faq/#builds-fail-on-all-my-custom-nodes)
- **Console logs stored for three months**: With this release, we've increased the duration of storing the console logs. Read details in our [documentation](http://docs.shippable.com/ci/advancedOptions/console-logs/)
- **OAuth login integration with GitLab EE**: This feature can be enabled in system integrations for **Server customers only**

## Server installer changes
- Removing a 'System integration' from the `state.json` file will remove the corresponding integration
- Drydock tag added to `systemMachineImages`
- Installer runs database clean up after provisioning services


## Fixes
- **Builds failed for few users upon resetting their custom nodes**: This fix ensures the correct packages for binaries are loaded and the Docker Hub images have correct versions. Builds will run successfully after a custom node reset
- **CI jobs fail when trying to pull Docker images**: Jobs failed due to a [Docker DNS issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/18842). This fix adds a nameserver to the stable/unstable AMIs and resolves the issue
- **Limits console size to 64 MB**: With this limit, if the console size exceeds 64 MB, you'll see the error `Console size exceeds 64 MB limit. Truncated from here`.
- **Escaping of CI environment variables is inconsistent and causes build failures**: We are now escaping more special characters for CI environment variables
- **jobConsole download file name is too generic**: Filename is now in format `org-project-runNumber.jobNumber.log`
- **Only Project owners can synchronize a project**: The fix allows super users and non-owners to synchronize a project
- **Super users unable to access `Account used to Process Webhooks`**: Fixes Super User access to `Account Used to Process Webhooks` panel in 'Project/Settings/runsConfig' section in the dashboard
- **API process does not retry a connection after a disconnect from RabbitMQ**: The fix ensures the API process ends when there's a disconnect from RabbitMQ. This notifies Swarm to bring up a new instance of the API process and reconnect to RabbitMQ

              }
          ]

     - For using notifications using mailgun insert the following systemIntegrations

          ```
            {
                "formJSONValues": [
                  {
                    "value": "<copy value from 'Mailgun NF 22' system integration>",
                    "label": "apiKey"
                  },
                  {
                    "value": "<copy value from 'Mailgun NF 22' system integration>",
                    "label": "domain"
                  }
                ],
                "masterName": "mailgunCreds",
                "name": "notification"
              }
          ```

     - Add `"drydockTag": "prod"` to existing `"systemMachineImages"`
     - Remove `dynamicNodesSystemIntegrationId` field from the `usr/state.json` file
     - Manually clean up S3 artifact systemIntegrations from DB/Vault and the `usr/state.json` file
     - Manually create a directory named logs in base/usr
     - Add a field `systemSettings.nodeScriptsRemoteLocation="https://github.com/Shippable/node/tarball"` in `usr/state.json`
     - [ ] Run `sudo apt-get update` on all machines
     - [ ] Enable/disable any integrations by adding/removing services in the `systemIntegration` section of the `state.json` file

- **Installation**:
     - [ ] Run `sudo ./base.sh --release v5.2.3`

- **Post installation**:
     - [ ] Stop the genexec/mexec container manually before resetting the systemNodes
     - [ ] Reset all system nodes
     - [ ] Verify genexec/mexec are running the latest version
