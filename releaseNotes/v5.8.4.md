    - Fixed duration for Consoles page and Admin Monitor Jobs page

5. Fixes in UI performance
    - A lot of UI performance related changes are making it to this release. We identified a lot of customer pain points after having constant feedback sessions with them. As a result, we've done significant changes to improve the UI performance.
    - These changes will be rolled out incrementally over next few releases after rigorous testing

### Features
1. Support stabilityDuration for non ECS providers [@a-murphy](https://github.com/a-murphy)
   - Adding a `stabilityDuration` to a `blueGreen` deploy job will periodically check if the new deployment is still running until that duration (in seconds) is reached. This has already been added to ECS deployments and will now be available for all `blueGreen` deploy jobs.
